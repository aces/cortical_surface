The cortical_surface package
============================

The primary goal of the cortical surface package is to create a quick
surface which very roughly fits the outer surface of the cortex. This
is primarily used for masking the cerebellum, dura, skull, and
brainstem away from the cerebrum, and therefore not designed to be a
high-quality surface fit. For that use the ASP package.
