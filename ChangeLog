	* A few minor fiddles with copnfigure.ac for compatibility
	* added a COPYING file so that the GPL does't get us

	* Repackage for minc2 m4 files; add epm-header
	* Remove absolute paths in perl scripts

	* Fixed scripts/msd_masks.pl to use -binary_mask in the call
        to surface_mask2. This avoids using a threshold=0.01 to detect
        the background. The new way is always correct and safe.

        * Fixed the surface models/avg_model_64.obj as the old one was
        self-intersecting between the two hemispheres. This surface is
        used as an initial guess by cortical_surface to build a mask to
        remove the skull. Overall, this fix will not affect the extraction
        of the skull, but this fix might become helpful in the future if
        we want to replace cortical_surface with the more robust CLASP
        to build the mask.
