        * Fixed the surface models/avg_model_64.obj as the old one was
        self-intersecting between the two hemispheres. This surface is
        used as an initial guess by cortical_surface to build a mask to
        remove the skull. Overall, this fix will not affect the extraction
        of the skull, but this fix might become helpful in the future if
        we want to replace cortical_surface with the more robust CLASP
        to build the mask.
